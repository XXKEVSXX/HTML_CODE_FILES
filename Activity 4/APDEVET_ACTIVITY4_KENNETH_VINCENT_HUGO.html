							AIX is an operating system developed by IBM and is in fact Unix-based. It is typically used for enterprise servers and comes with a robust 
							set of security options such as Kerberos V5 network authentication and dynamic secure tunnel authentication. AIX allows the system administrator 
							to divide memory, CPU, and disk access between various jobs. The system supports IBM's 64-bit POWER processor and is backwards-compatible with 32-bit 
							applications. It also runs most Linux applications (after recompiling them) and has full support for Java 2. If all that jargon makes no sense to you, relax --
							 AIX is not your typical consumer operating system. It is mainly used for servers in large businesses where IT geeks get to work with it.</ul>

						<ul><h1>Backbone</h1></ul>
						<ul>Just like the human <u><em>Backbone</em></u> carries signals to many smaller nerves in the body, 
							a network backbone carries data to smaller lines of transmission. A local backbone refers to the main 
							network lines that connect several local area networks (<a href="#" class="text-primary">LANs</a>)

						<ul><h4>Backup is the most important computer term you should know.</h4></ul>
						<ul>A backup is a copy of one or more files created as an alternate in case the original data is lost or becomes unusable. 
							For example, you may save several copies of a research paper on your hard drive as backup files in case you decide to use a previous revision. 
							Better yet, you could save the backups to a USB flash disk, which would also protect the files if the hard drive failed.</abbr>

							of a <a href="#" class="text-primary">network</a>  or 
							<a href="#" class="text-primary">Internet connection</a> . It measures how

							<a href="#" class="text-primary">Mbps</a> (

							or may be highly irregular, making it nearly impossible for an automated program to recognize it. (Of course, some captchas 
							are so distorted that they can be difficult for humans to recognize as well.) Fortunately, most captchas allow the user to 
							regenerate the image if the text is too difficult to read.
